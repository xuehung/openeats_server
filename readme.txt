How to run on localhost
1. install jdk 6+
2. change settings in /conf/securesocial.conf, making sure you edit the google clientId and clientSecret
3. go to https://cloud.google.com/console, create a project, register app and enter your correct redirect url such as http://localhost:9000/authenticate/google
4. type run in the command line and hit enter, this will start up the server at port 9000 and open a Java remote debug port at 9999
5. open http://localhost:9000 with your prefered browser

Note: You can skip step 3, I've configured a google client key and secret using my own account
